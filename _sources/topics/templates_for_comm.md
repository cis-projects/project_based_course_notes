## Organising your Kick-off Meeting

The kick-off meeting is an important milestone in your project for many reasons, it’s the first time you will meet your host, provide your interpretation of the project, and provides you with the opportunity to ask any questions you may have.
To best prepare you for this meeting it is suggested you meet with your team to review the steps below. It is recommended you tick the items as you work through them to ensure nothing is missed and you and your team are well prepared at this initial meeting.

### Step 1 – Getting Started

Your group will need to meet to discuss:

- [ ] Who will be your main communicator with your industry partner?
- [ ] What background (if any) reading/research is required by your industry partner before you meet them?
- [ ] Familiarise yourself with your industry partner organisation and the people you will be meeting

### Step 2 – Contacting your industry partner

Introducing your team:

- [ ] Send an email introduction (using the template available below) to your industry host and cc your subject coordinator, your UoM academic supervisor, and your project team
- [ ] Request suitable times from your industry host for the initial meeting, keeping in mind they will be very busy
- [ ] Ask the preferred duration
- [ ] Ask your host if they have any specific items for the agenda
- [ ] Confirm if they prefer Zoom, Teams, or another platform

### Step 3 – Schedule the meeting

- [ ] Set up a google calendar: https://www.google.com/calendar. [Details available here](https://cis-projects.github.io/project_based_course_notes/topics/client_communications.html)
- [ ] Ensure you invite all key people to the meeting: industry host(s), project team, subject coordinator, and UoM academic supervisor
- [ ] Include link to virtual meeting
- [ ] Create agenda for the meeting (using the agenda template on page 4) and attach this to the meeting invite

### Step 4 – Prepare for the meeting

- [ ] What reading have you been requested to do prior to your initial meeting with your industry host?
- [ ] What further research can your group undertake about the host organisation and the people you will be meeting? (Google, LinkedIn, company databases such as Company360 etc)
- [ ] What questions will your team ask and who will ask them?
- [ ] What will you wear?
- [ ] Who will chair the meeting and who will take minutes/notes?
- [ ] Practice your ‘elevator pitch’ – Who are you? What skillset do you bring? Why are you interested in the project?

### Step 5 – Conducting the meeting

- [ ] Ensure the person taking minutes is prepared and ready to take notes
- [ ] If meeting online, ensure your cameras are ON
- [ ] Ask questions prepared earlier and take notes on your understanding and add new questions if the need arises
- [ ] Confirm next steps with your industry host

### Step 6 – Post meeting

- [ ] Review the minutes
- [ ] Within 24 hrs of your meeting, send email (using the template on the page 5) including all decisions and next steps with a request to confirm accuracy. Include relevant industry hosts(s), your project team, your subject coordinator and UoM academic supervisor
- [ ] Review the project charter and develop the project plan

## Other Items

It is important to reach out if you have any questions, as keeping these to yourself or within your team can delay projects and/or they can veer in the wrong direction. If you have questions for your industry host, ask them! And if you’re unsure, please feel free to email your subject coordinator and/or academic supervisor.

### Zoom meetings
- For many of you, Zoom will be your primary platform for communicating with each other and your industry host.

	To create a better experience for you and your host, when creating a Zoom meeting, please ensure you are creating it using your unimelb.edu.au Zoom account. By using your UniMelb Zoom account, your meetings will have unlimited length, as opposed to 40 mins for non-UniMelb/free Zoom accounts.

- If you experience difficulty setting up your UniMelb Zoom account or have any other questions, please review the universities online resources or contact Student IT.

- Some host organisations do not permit Zoom due to security issues. If your host prefers Teams, please explain to them they will have to create the calendar invites, as the UniMelb Teams student licence does not include Calendar functionality.

### Professionalism online
- To present professionally it’s important to set up the below:

	- Update your email settings to include an email signature including: preferred name, email address, mobile number, LinkedIn profile.

	- Update your Zoom settings with: preferred name, professionally appropriate photo and a virtual background.
