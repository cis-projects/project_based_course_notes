# Client Communications Guide

## Introduction

In capstone subjects, your team will deliver a real-world project to an external client. This guide is designed to help you navigate client interactions, from initial contact through ongoing communication and documentation.

## Client Assignment

Your client will be assigned by the Subject Coordinator. Once assigned, it is crucial to establish and maintain a close working relationship with your client throughout the semester. You'll need their input to:

1. Develop system requirements.
2. Review progress after each sprint.
3. Provide feedback on prototypes.

Effective communication is key to making informed product decisions and incorporating client feedback.

## Initial Contact with Your Client

### Role of the Product Owner

The Product Owner acts as the primary point of contact between the team and the client. They are responsible for sending updates, meeting invitations, and other communications.

### Contacting Your Client

- **First Email:** Use the provided email address to introduce your team and propose a time for an initial meeting.
- **Scheduling Tools:** Utilize tools like [When2Meet](https://www.when2meet.com) to find a mutually convenient meeting time.

### Email Templates and Meeting Invites

- **Email Templates:** Access templates for client communication [here](https://cis-projects.github.io/project_based_course_notes/extras/templates_for_comm.html).
- **Calendar Invites:** After agreeing on a meeting time, send a calendar invite. Instructions [here](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/72143?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#zippy=).
- **Virtual Meetings:** Use the university's Zoom account for online meetings. Setup guide [here](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/zoom_for_gmail/585972765488).

## Conducting Client Meetings

### Preparing for the Meeting
